# HL-wp-signup
A simple Wordpress plugin that allows you to add a Heyloyalty signup form to posts/pages.

## How It Works
Once you have created a form in your Heyloyalty dashboard, you can copy/paste the iframe - and insert it into the relevant form field on the admin page. You can then choose to either display the form as an addition to the content on every post/page, or you can use a shortcode to insert it wherever you want in the content.

## Planned functionality
* Using the API credentials to set up a custom form, entering the API key and secret key on the options page
* Giving users the opportunity to choose for themselves which fields to populate their custom form with (only email being mandatory)

* A widget for Heyloyalty forms (this, together with the content append and shortcode option, would make the plugin a lot more versatile)
