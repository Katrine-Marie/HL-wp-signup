# HL-wp-signup
A Wordpress plugin that lets you to add a Heyloyalty signup form to posts/pages.

## How It Works

### Setting Up the Form
You can either copy/paste the code for a form you've created in the Heyloyalty dashboard - or you can use your API key and secret key along with a list ID, to set up a custom form.

Both these options are available at the admin options page.

### Adding the Form To Your Website
You have three options for including the form on your website.

* Display the form as an addition to the content on every post/page by ticking the appropriate checkbox in the admin dashboard.
* Use a shortcode to insert it wherever you want in the content or in a text widget.
* Use the included HL WP Widget.

## Planned functionality
* Using the API credentials to set up a custom form, entering the API key and secret key on the options page
* Giving users the opportunity to choose for themselves which fields to populate their custom form with (only email being mandatory)

* A widget for Heyloyalty forms (this, together with the content append and shortcode option, would make the plugin a lot more versatile)
