# HL-wp-signup
A Wordpress plugin that lets you to add a Heyloyalty signup form to posts/pages.

## How It Works

### Setting Up the Form
You can either copy/paste the code for a form you've created in the Heyloyalty dashboard - or you can use your API key and secret key along with a list ID, to set up a custom form. If you set up a custom form, you can also choose which fields to include.

Both these options are available at the admin options page.

NOTE: The advanced settings override the simple ones.

### Adding the Form To Your Website
You have three options for including the form on your website.

* Append the form to the content on every (single) post or page by ticking the appropriate checkbox in the admin dashboard.
* Use the `[heyloyalty_wp_signup]` shortcode to insert the form wherever you want in the content (or in a text widget).
* Use the included HL WP Widget to place the signup form in a widget area such as the sidebar or footer. .
