# HL-wp-signup
A simple Wordpress plugin that allows you to add a Heyloyalty signup form to posts/pages.

## How It Works
Once you have created a form in your Heyloyalty dashboard, you can copy/paste the iframe - and insert it into the relevant form field on the admin page. You can then choose to either display the form as an addition to the content on every post/page, or you can use a shortcode to insert it wherever you want in the content.

## Planned functionality
In the nearest future, this plugin will be expanded to allow you to use your API credentials to set up a custom form. In this case, you would enter your API key and secret key on the options page, and then decide which fields to populate your form with, and whether or not you wish to include it on all posts, or just selected ones.
