# HL-wp-signup
A simple Wordpress plugin that adds a Heyloyalty signup form to posts/pages.

## How It Works
Once you have created a form in your Heyloyalty dashboard, you can copy/paste the iframe - and insert it into the relevant form field on the admin page. You can then choose to either display the form as an addition to the content on every post/page, or you can use a shortcode to insert it wherever you want in the content.
